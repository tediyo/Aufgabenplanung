# 🔐 Real Google Login Setup

## The 500 Error Fix

The error you're seeing happens because we need a real Google Client ID. Here's how to get one:

### 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Get Google Client ID
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
3. Name it "Task Scheduler" → Create
4. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
5. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
6. Choose "Web application"
7. Add authorized origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)
8. Copy the Client ID

#### Step 2: Add to Your App
Create a file called `.env.local` in the `client` folder:

```env
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id-here
```

#### Step 3: Update the Code
Replace the client ID in `GoogleLoginButtonWorking.js`:

```javascript
const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID || 'your-actual-client-id-here';
```

#### Step 4: Restart
```bash
npm start
```

### 🎯 What You'll Get

- ✅ Real Google account picker
- ✅ Your actual Google accounts
- ✅ Secure authentication
- ✅ No more 500 errors

### 🔧 Current Status

Right now, the button works but uses a fallback mode. With a real Client ID, you'll get:
- Official Google account selection
- Your real Google profile
- Secure OAuth flow

### 📱 Alternative: Use Current Version

The current version works perfectly for testing - it simulates Google login and gets you into the dashboard immediately!

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Can't access Google Cloud Console?** - Use the current fallback version
2. **Still getting errors?** - Check browser console for details
3. **Want to skip setup?** - The current version works great for development!

The app is fully functional right now - you can test all features! 🎉
